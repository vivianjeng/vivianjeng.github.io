I graduated from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/) with a master's degree in **Computer Science and Information Engineering**. I was an exchange student at [Rheinisch-Westf√§lische Technische Hochschule Aachen (RWTH Aachen)](https://www.rwth-aachen.de/) in Germany for one year during 2019/2020.

My research interests are including **blockchain technologies**, **privacy and security**, and **cryptography**. I am doing research as a research assistant in [Communication and Multimedia lab (CMLab)](https://www.cmlab.csie.ntu.edu.tw/) at National Taiwan University.
